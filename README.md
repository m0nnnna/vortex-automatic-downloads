Make sure the script and the image files are inside the same directory. 

You will need to change image3 to whatever closes your browser image can be done using snipping tool on Windows.

No more than 1 button can be on screen at any given time or it will keep pressing the same button, it's okay if the web browsers focus covers the Vortex client because once it starts downloading it will refocus back to the Vortex client window. 

You will need to install a few dependancies. 

pip install opencv-python
pip install Pillow
pip install pyscreeze
pip install pyautogui
pip install pyautogui
